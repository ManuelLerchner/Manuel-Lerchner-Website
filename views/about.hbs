                                Hi!<br />
                                My name is Manuel Lerchner and I am passionate
                                about informatics, programming, and science.
                            </p>
                            <p class="section">
                                Ever since my early childhood, I have been very
                                interested in technology and how technical
                                devices work. This interest continues to the
                                present day, and even today I forget everything
                                around me when I'm tinkering with a project.
                                Especially in the last few years, my interest
                                has increasingly turned towards computer
                                technology, which has allowed me to spend more
                                time on computer science in my spare time. Thus
                                I could already collect some programming
                                experiences in different programming languages
                                during the realization of smaller projects.
                                <br />I love learning, solving problems, and
                                building things and I want to use these talents
                                to design things and create systems that benefit
                                humanity and want to have a part in developing
                                technologies that will improve peopleâ€™s lives
                                and help further our understanding of the
                                universe.
